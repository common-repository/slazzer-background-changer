Remove or change backgrounds of WooCommerce product images automatically.

== Description ==

*The Slazzer Background Changer* is a WordPress plugin that allows you to automatically remove/change any image background directly in WooCommerce and Wordpress. 

In just a few seconds, you can easily set a transparent background for your products, change the color or upload your own custom images. Just make sure your subject is clearly in the foreground, meaning that there should be a clear distinction between the foreground and background on your image. [Slazzer](https://www.slazzer.com) works exceptionally well for products, people, animals and cars. 


= KEY FEATURES:  =

*   High quality detailing, no manual intervention
*   Automatically remove or change any product background in seconds
*   Process all images at once or only specified ones
*   Choose which image types to process (Main image or Gallery images)
*   Backup and restore original images

= SUPPORTED IMAGES:  =

Slazzer supports any  JPG/JPEG or PNG image with up to 12 megabytes. All images need to have a clear subject that is meant to be in the foreground. As we mentioned, Slazzer works great for products, people, animals and cars. For PNG images, if the resolution is larger than 10 megapixels (e.g. 4000 × 2500 pixels or any other aspect ratio) it is resized to this maximum resolution. For JPG/JPEG if the resolution is larger than 25 megapixels (e.g. 6250 × 4000 pixels or any other aspect ratio) it is resized to this maximum resolution.

= WHAT IF I AM UNSATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS?  =

We recommend to first test the results with a few products by providing their IDs in the plugin settings. If you are not totally satisfied, you can easily restore to the original images. If you are ok with results, then you can move ahead with removing and changing the backgrounds of all your images. Make sure to have an active Slazzer plan [here](https://www.slazzer.com/pricing).

= HOW TO USE  =

*   Install the Slazzer plugin in Wordpress
*   Add your product photos
*   Click “Slazzer Background Changer”
*   Paste your API key. Make sure to have a Slazzer account. You can sign up [here](https://www.slazzer.com/signup) and get your API key [here](https://www.slazzer.com/account#api-key).
*   Choose options according to your liking. ( e.g. background colors, custom uploads etc..). You can hover all options.
*   Click “Save changes” and “Start process”
*   Go to your “Products” to see the results
*   At any time, if you’re not satisfied with the results, click “Restore Backup” to restore to your original images
*   That’s it, you’re done!

= General Recommendations =

*   Alignment: Images should have proper orientation. (e.g. the floor is at the bottom of the image and the sky is at the top).
*   Contrast: Images should be taken under ideal lighting conditions with a clear distinction between the foreground and background.
*   Monotone Backgrounds: Single color or blur backgrounds are easier to remove than overly detailed and sharp backgrounds.
*   Sharp foreground: If the foreground is fuzzy or blurry it might get removed by our AI. If only the contour or edges are blurry, they will still be blurry in the resulting cutout (which may or may not be an issue).


= Recommendations for Product images and other objects =

*   Entire object: The entire product should be visible in the image, e.g. make sure it’s not cut off.
*   Object in focus: Products should be in front of a plain background (photo studio, wall, or floor).
*   Shadows and reflections: Try to avoid extensive shadows or reflections as they can be mistaken to be part of the foreground.
*   Leave out decorations: Do not place decorative objects in the image. Do not add icons, logos, stamps or art to the image before uploading it.

= Recommendations for images of People =

*   Number of people: Images with a single person or with a few people perform better than photos with large groups of people.
*   Objects: Objects held in the subject’s hands or worn on the body are usually supported (e.g. glove), whereas large objects standing out can be an issue.

= Recommendations for images of Animals =

*   Number of animals: Images with a single animal or with a few animals perform better than photos with large groups of animals.

= Recommendations for Car images =
*   Avoid unnecessary angles: The photo should be ideally at eye level.
*   Non Obstructed: The car should not be obstructed by any object or subject.
*   One at a time: For best results, only include one car in each photo. Only the largest most visible and largest car will be cut out, everything else will be considered a background.
